# aha-ember

## Introduction and Purpose

"aha-ember" is an attempt to create relevant, up-to date and easy to follow tutorials in the form of videos, articles and demo applications to understand the nuances of the EmberJS framework.

"aha-ember" is born out of the need to have a resource that covers each and every minute aspect of the framework that addreses the pain pionts in learning Ember; things that have not been covered in detail on the EmberJS website and how these small nuances play together to form a cohesive application framework and improve developer productivity. Knowing each and every convention of Ember and how these conventions behave under different points in the lifecycle of a project will not only help learn the framework faster, but will allow you to debug your applications quicker.

This project is completely open-source and we invite people from the EmberJS community to contribute to the library of content we hope to achieve over time. Content may inlcude the smallest of topics such as what an `{{outlet}}` is and how it works to dependency injection and the inner working on the Ember Run Loop.

We follow a very simple convention; each topic is unit of learning that addresses a specific feature in EmberJS. This may be a video, an article or a sample application. The content must include an introductory portion explaining the reason for it's existence (this may be a pain point faced by the developer in learning the feature, or how to use the feature in conjunction with another) and any pre-requisite knowledge that may be required. If it's Ember related, it fits.
